# Simple React To-Do List with Filtering

This is a simple and clean To-Do List application built with **React** and **TypeScript**, following best practices for component structure, state management, and type safety. The app allows users to add, complete, and filter to-do items.

## âœ¨ Features

* Add new to-do items
* Mark items as completed
* Filter tasks by buttons:

* All - A list to show all tasks
* Active - A list of only active tasks
* Completed - A list of only completed tasks.

* Fully written in **TypeScript**
* Modular and reusable component structure
